### NumPy SciPy Testing 
# Overview
`fft-testing.py` serves as a "template" for simple signal > FFT > iFFT > output. The script will create a wav file as well as graph both the preprocessed and postprocessed waveforms. Any additional scripts function will be noted by name. 

# Required libs
This script was written with Python3 v3.11.4. Libraries used are (will be updated):
    - NumPy v1.24.2
    - SciPy v1.11.1
    - MatPlotLib v3.7.2
